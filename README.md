# IMULogger
An IMU data logger 

This app was created for research of a now abandoned project but I tought it looked cool so I put it here. This project is now discarded as I lost the source code and essential elements have not been developed and there are buttons that do nothing. ,


Usage: press the button labeled "datalogger". Press the button labeled "activate" and logging will start. When you want to stop logging, long press the button labeled "terminate" untill a vibration and then release. Logging is now stopped and you can close the app. Unfortunately the button labeled "em" does not have a function implemented. Intended function was to set a marker for the data. Intended function for the app was the ability to store recorded data.

NOTE: This app is developed for Android mobile phones so it must be run on an Android device or an Adnroid emulator.
